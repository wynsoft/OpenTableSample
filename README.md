# The OpenTable Sample

This project was built with React JS and Redux to demostrate the use of Redux. It consumes the OpenTable API available at https://opentable.herokuapp.com.

## Usage

Type in a city name and click the `Get` button. Once the results are displayed a `Refine` text box will appear. This will allow you to filter on the Restaurant Name and Address.

### Demo

A live demo is available at https://wynsoftsystems.com/opentable.
